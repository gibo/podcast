    <description><![CDATA[It's the Frank &amp; Pat Holiday Special! Donna's already been, and Jenny has only just up and left. We've devised what we think is a pretty good soundtrack to the upcoming warmer months. 

Here's the playlist if your head can't handle much more chat, and just to warn you – this is the last Frank and Pat for a few weeks, because we are literally on holiday. This is not a drill.

The Royal bets are on, and we think we've cracked what it's going to be called. We're preparing our smug faces for the official announcement. We also talk about how annoying Jeremy Clarkson is – this is nothing to do with the Royal youngster, and don't let it put you off.

    <description><![CDATA[This week we are forever celebrating, starting with a 90% chicken based dinner supplied by a well known fast food chain (rhyming with pac bonalds), accompanied by a delicious bottle of budget Prosecco (from a shop rhyming with Fiddle) . . . 

We road test 36 Questions which are guaranteed to make someone fall in love with you, chat about Gwyneth Paltrow (G –Pal) and her new vaginal steaming obsession*, make an abysmal attempt to get a Frank &amp; Pat catchphrase started, and all whilst playing you a super selection of music. 

PAAARTAAAAAY.
